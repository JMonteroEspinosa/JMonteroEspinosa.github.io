Welcome, bienvenidos! I'm still building the site, so please wait for updates on data analysis projects!

I plan to share with you many projects in Python and R. For example, we will revise code to draw multicolored plot lines of a time-changing variable, do Pareto interpolation, build your own interactive plots with matplotlib, and many more applications!

In case you were wondering, I'm using Jekyll to create this website. Find out more <a href='https://jekyllrb.com/'>here</a>
