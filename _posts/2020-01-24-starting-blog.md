Welcome, bienvenidos! I'm still building the site, so please wait for updates with some data analysis projects!

I plan to share with you many projects in Python and R. For example, we will revise code to draw figures based on the ruling party in Spain,
do Pareto interpolation, build your own interactive plots with matplotlib, and many more applications!

In case you were wondering, I'm using Jekyll to create this webpage. Find out more at https://jekyllrb.com/
